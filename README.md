# Recipe Scraper CLI

Command line interface for scraping recipes from a website built in Ruby. It uses two Ruby gems: Nokogiri and OpenURI to accomplish the scraping.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo to your local environment.

Change to the project directory in terminal and type the following command to run the program.

```

You will be prompted to enter a recipe number from the list to view the details of that recipe.

Hit enter after typing in the recipe number and the recipe will be output to the terminal.

Have fun!
